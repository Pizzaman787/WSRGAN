# WSRGAN
A Wasserstein Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network I made by following some tutorials and combining some notes I found online.

Some of the references used:
- https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Super-Resolution
  - This one was referenced for the newest version of the model (model_new31)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG0QZ7OddX4
  - This one was used to implement the wasserstein part of the model
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-computer-vision-pytorch/
  - This was used to learn about convolutionary networks or layers
